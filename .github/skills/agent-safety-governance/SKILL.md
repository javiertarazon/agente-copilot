# Agent Safety & Governance Framework

Validate, constrain, and audit autonomous agent actions before they affect production systems. Based on the **Agent Safety Reviewer** and **Devil's Advocate** agents from github/awesome-copilot.

## Core Principle

> "An autonomous agent that can't be stopped is not an asset — it's a liability."

Safety governance answers: **What can this agent do? What should it NOT do? Who reviews what it did?**

## Risk Classification

### Action Risk Levels

| Risk Level | Examples | Approval Required |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| 🟢 **LOW** | Read files, search codebase, generate code suggestions | None — auto-execute |
| 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Write/edit files, install packages, run tests | Log + continue |
| 🟠 **HIGH** | Delete files, modify config, commit/push | Human review checkpoint |
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Drop database, modify secrets, external API calls with side effects | Explicit confirmation + audit |

---

## Pre-Execution Checklist

Before any autonomous task, validate:

### 1. Scope Validation
```
✅ Does the task stay within the defined scope?
✅ Are the files to be modified listed in the task manifest?
✅ Is the agent working in the correct project directory?
✅ Is there a git checkpoint to rollback to?
```

### 2. Dangerous Pattern Detection

Scan planned actions for:

```python
DANGEROUS_PATTERNS = [
    # File operations
    "rm -rf", "shutil.rmtree", "fs.rmSync", "os.remove",
    
    # Environment modification  
    ".env", "process.env", "os.environ", "secrets",
    
    # Network with side effects
    "POST /production", "DELETE /api", "PUT /prod",
    
    # Database
    "DROP TABLE", "DELETE FROM", "TRUNCATE",
    
    # Shell injection risks
    "subprocess.call", "exec(", "eval(", "shell=True",
    
    # Credential exposure
    "password", "api_key", "token", "secret" + "print|log|console"
]
```

If any pattern detected → **PAUSE and require human review**.

### 3. Resource Limits

```yaml
agent_limits:
  max_files_modified: 20          # Per task
  max_file_size_kb: 500           # Max file to write
  max_test_iterations: 10         # TDD fix loops
  max_orchestration_depth: 5      # Nested sub-agents
  timeout_minutes: 30             # Hard stop
  allowed_directories:
    - "src/"
    - "tests/"
    - "docs/"
  forbidden_directories:
    - ".env*"
    - "*.secret"
    - "infra/"
    - ".ssh/"
```

## Devil's Advocate Review

Before completing any significant change, apply adversarial review:

### Questions to challenge the solution:

**Correctness:**
- What happens if the input is null/empty/negative?
- What's the worst-case performance (time + memory)?
- Are all error paths handled?

**Security:**
- Does this introduce any SQL injection vectors?
- Could an attacker exploit this change?
- Are secrets ever logged or exposed?

**Reliability:**
- What happens if the database is down?
- What if the external API returns 500?
- Is this idempotent (safe to call twice)?

**Maintainability:**
- Will the next developer understand this in 6 months?
- Are the test names descriptive enough?
- Is there hidden coupling?

**Completeness:**
- Were any edge cases missed?
- Are migrations backwards-compatible?
- Is the documentation updated?

## Audit Trail Format

Every agent action should be logged:

```jsonl
{"ts":"2026-02-23T14:30:00Z","agent":"gem-orchestrator","action":"write_file","path":"src/services/user.ts","risk":"medium","outcome":"success","lines_changed":47}
{"ts":"2026-02-23T14:30:15Z","agent":"polyglot-test-pipeline","action":"run_tests","framework":"jest","outcome":"8_pass_0_fail","coverage":"87%"}
{"ts":"2026-02-23T14:31:00Z","agent":"context-architect","action":"multi_file_change","files_affected":5,"risk":"high","human_reviewed":true,"outcome":"success"}
```

Log location: `copilot-agent/audit-log.jsonl`

---

## Rollback Protocol

### Automatic rollback triggers:
- Test failure rate > 20% after agent changes
- TypeScript/compile errors introduced
- File deletion detected outside whitelist
- Timeout exceeded

### Rollback commands:
```bash
# Git rollback
git stash  # undo uncommitted changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # undo last commit

# PowerShell equivalent
git checkout -- .  # discard all unstaged changes
```

### Checkpoint strategy:
```
Before starting:    git commit -m "checkpoint: pre-agent-task"
After each phase:   git commit -m "checkpoint: post-research-phase"
After completion:   git commit -m "feat: <description> [agent-assisted]"
```

## Governance Checklist (for Agent Task Review)

Use this checklist when reviewing agent-proposed changes:

```
SCOPE
[ ] Changes are confined to listed files
[ ] No unauthorized external API calls
[ ] No credential or secret access

CODE QUALITY  
[ ] Tests written or updated
[ ] No obvious security vulnerabilities
[ ] Error handling present
[ ] No dead code introduced

SAFETY
[ ] No irreversible operations (unguarded deletes)
[ ] Rollback is possible at any point
[ ] Audit log entry created

COMPLETENESS
[ ] All acceptance criteria met
[ ] Documentation updated if public API changed
[ ] Migration scripts included if schema changed
```

## Integration with OpenClaw

- Use with `agent-orchestration` to add safety gates between sub-agent calls
- Apply **Devil's Advocate** review before `context-multi-file` commits
- Combine with `verification-before-completion` for final checks
- Log to `copilot-agent/audit-log.jsonl` (already used by OpenClaw agent system)
